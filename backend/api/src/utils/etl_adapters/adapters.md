The provided code snippets from the `foursquare-fullstack` project involve components for interacting with the Foursquare API, constructing objects from the retrieved data, and integrating these objects with a PostgreSQL database. Here's a brief overview of each file's role:

1. **Client (`client.py`)**:
   - This class is responsible for making HTTP requests to the Foursquare API. It includes methods to authenticate requests ([auth_params](file:///Users/kielay/Developer/projects/foursquare-fullstack/backend/api/src/adapters/client.py#8%2C9-8%2C9)), merge authentication with query parameters ([full_params](file:///Users/kielay/Developer/projects/foursquare-fullstack/backend/api/src/adapters/client.py#13%2C9-13%2C9)), search for venues ([request_venues](file:///Users/kielay/Developer/projects/foursquare-fullstack/backend/api/src/adapters/run_adapters.py#16%2C30-16%2C30)), and retrieve detailed information about a specific venue ([request_venue](file:///Users/kielay/Developer/projects/foursquare-fullstack/backend/tests/adapters/test_client.py#11%2C5-11%2C5)).
   - It uses the [requests](file:///Users/kielay/Developer/projects/company-data-etl/tasks.md#53%2C50-53%2C50) library to make GET requests to the Foursquare API and parses the JSON response to return relevant data.

2. **RequestAndBuild (`run_adapters.py`)**:
   - This class orchestrates the process of fetching data from the Foursquare API and building database objects from that data.
   - It initializes a [Client](file:///Users/kielay/Developer/projects/foursquare-fullstack/backend/tests/adapters/test_client.py#2%2C37-2%2C37) to fetch venue data and a [Builder](file:///Users/kielay/Developer/projects/foursquare-fullstack/backend/api/src/adapters/run_adapters.py#9%2C33-9%2C33) to construct objects. It then executes a sequence where it searches for venues based on provided search parameters ([ll](file:///Users/kielay/Developer/projects/foursquare-fullstack/backend/tests/adapters/test_client.py#3%2C11-3%2C11) for latitude and longitude, [query](file:///Users/kielay/Developer/projects/foursquare-fullstack/backend/api/src/adapters/run_adapters.py#14%2C23-14%2C23) for the search term), fetches detailed information for each venue, and uses the [Builder](file:///Users/kielay/Developer/projects/foursquare-fullstack/backend/api/src/adapters/run_adapters.py#9%2C33-9%2C33) to create and return objects representing those venues.

3. **Builder and Sub-Classes (`venues_builder.py`)**:
   - The [Builder](file:///Users/kielay/Developer/projects/foursquare-fullstack/backend/api/src/adapters/run_adapters.py#9%2C33-9%2C33) class and its sub-classes ([VenueBuilder](file:///Users/kielay/Developer/projects/foursquare-fullstack/backend/api/src/adapters/venues_builder.py#10%2C17-10%2C17), [LocationBuilder](file:///Users/kielay/Developer/projects/foursquare-fullstack/backend/api/src/adapters/venues_builder.py#15%2C24-15%2C24), [CategoryBuilder](file:///Users/kielay/Developer/projects/foursquare-fullstack/backend/api/src/adapters/venues_builder.py#16%2C32-16%2C32)) are responsible for constructing database objects from the raw data returned by the Foursquare API.
   - [VenueBuilder](file:///Users/kielay/Developer/projects/foursquare-fullstack/backend/api/src/adapters/venues_builder.py#10%2C17-10%2C17) selects and organizes venue attributes, checks if a venue already exists in the database, and either finds the existing venue or saves a new one.
   - [LocationBuilder](file:///Users/kielay/Developer/projects/foursquare-fullstack/backend/api/src/adapters/venues_builder.py#15%2C24-15%2C24) processes location-related data, ensuring that city, state, and zipcode objects are properly created or found and associated with the venue.
   - [CategoryBuilder](file:///Users/kielay/Developer/projects/foursquare-fullstack/backend/api/src/adapters/venues_builder.py#16%2C32-16%2C32) handles the categorization of venues, ensuring that categories are created or found and associated with the venue.

Together, these components form a system that can query the Foursquare API for venue data, parse and organize that data, and populate a PostgreSQL database with structured representations of the venues, their locations, and categories.
